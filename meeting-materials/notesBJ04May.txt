I am sending you the document that I presented at todayâ€™s meeting, which roughly summarizes how we could think about optimizing the overall pipeline for screening potential target molecules for COVID-19.
Since these are just my initial ideas, I believe there are many things we could do to update the document to make the idea more realistic/useful.

Possibilities include:

- define the objective (reward/cost) in a different manner
- think about using multiple features from stage-i for selecting molecules that will be passed to stage-(I+1) for further screening
- rather than simple thresholding, when we use multiple outputs/features obtained from stage-i filter, we could think about using more complicated decision boundaries learned via AI/ML
- from simple to more advanced strategies for learning the unknown joint PDF f() for the scores/features from the multiple stages.

Please feel free to make any suggestions or ask any questions you may have!
Thank you.

Best,

Byung-Jun
