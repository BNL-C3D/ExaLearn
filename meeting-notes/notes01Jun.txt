Some notes and todos:

- Pseudo-code for Byung-Jun’s application
- Byung-Jun to share a pointer to the python code for KO (not the pycuda implementation)
- Understanding scaling requirements for Byung-Jun’s application and plan implementation
- Investigate / generality to SEIR application
- Review pseudo-code for Anthony’s application and examine similarity of the workflow / computational execution to Byung-Jun’s application. Start planning experiments.
